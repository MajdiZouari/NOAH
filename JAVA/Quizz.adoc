== Java Platform
 *  Why is Java so popular?
-----------------
 u serious ?
-----------------
 
 *  What is platform independence?
 
-----------------
"Write Once, Run Evrywhere" est le moto de Java. En fait, l'indépendance du système consiste 
à développer le même code quel que soit la plateforme sur laquelle il tourne.
----------------- 

 *  What is bytecode?
 
-----------------
Une fois le code est compilé, il en génére du bytecode qui sera exécuté sur la JVM.
----------------- 

 *  Compare JDK vs JVM vs JRE 
 
-----------------
JVM : charge et exécute le code et provide un runtime envirement
JRE : est une implémentation de la JVM avec d'autres librairies
JDK : Offre avec la JRE toutes les librairies nécessaires au développement et à la compilation du code
----------------- 
 
 *  What are the important differences between C++ and Java?
 
-----------------
C++ n'est pas un language Platfrom dependant. Il tourne pas sur une VM.
JAVA ne permet pas l'héritage multiple.
-----------------  

 *  What is the role for a classloader in Java?
-----------------
Le classloader: vérifie le nom d'une classe, si une classe a déjà été chargée,
vérifie si la classe est une classe Système. Résoud la classe et retourne la classe
à son appelant. 
-----------------  
 
 
== Wrapper Classes
 
 *  What are Wrapper classes?
-----------------
Depuis Java 5 et l'introduction du autoboxing at unboxing, on est capable de passer d'un type natif à un objet directement. i.e de int vers Integer, de boolean à Boolean.. etc la classe Boolean est une wrapper class de boolean
----------------- 
 *  Why do we need Wrapper classes in Java?
----------------- 
Pour qu'on puisse ajouter un l'objet dans une collection.
Pour que null soit possible..
-----------------  
  *  What are the different ways of creating Wrapper class instances?
-----------------  
1- Par construction ; un constructeur qui prend en entrée la valeur du type primitif ou a représentation en String de la valeur.
2- Par methode static ; une méthode static valueOf() de la classe wrapper qui permet de crée l'objet.
-----------------  
  *  What are differences in the two ways of creating Wrapper classes?
-----------------  
La différence est que la première fait appel à un constructeur et l'autre à une méthode static !
-----------------    
  *  What is auto boxing?
-----------------
C'est la conversion automatique entre les wrapper objects et leur type primitif correspondant
-----------------    
  *  What are the advantages of auto boxing?
-----------------  
L'avantage ; plus simple à écrire.. un souci en moins...
-----------------

  *  What is implicit casting?
  *  What is explicit casting?

  *  What is the use of equals method in Java?
  *  What are the important things to consider when implementing equals method?
  *  What is the Hashcode method used for in Java?
-----------------
Le Hashcode est une représentation numérique du 'contenu' de l'objet.
Il sert à représenter l'objet dans les collections hashées (hashset, hashmap).
Deux Objets égaux ont le même hashcode. De ce fait, il sert de clé d'unicité dans ces collections.
Par conséquent, il est important de réimplémenter Hashcode si on rééimplemente "equals" pour garder cette cohérence.
